        Returns a list of action instances for a particular publish. This
        method is called each time a user clicks a publish somewhere in the UI.
        The data returned from this hook will be used to populate the actions
        menu for a publish.

        The mapping between Publish types and actions are kept in a different
        place (in the configuration) so at the point when this hook is called,
        the loader app has already established *which* actions are appropriate
        for this object.

        The hook should return at least one action for each item passed in via
        the actions parameter.

        This method needs to return detailed data for those actions, in the
        form of a list of dictionaries, each with name, params, caption and
        description keys.

        Because you are operating on a particular publish, you may tailor the
        output  (caption, tooltip etc) to contain custom information suitable
        for this publish.

        The ui_area parameter is a string and indicates where the publish is to
        be shown.
        - If it will be shown in the main browsing area, "main" is passed.
        - If it will be shown in the details area, "details" is passed.
        - If it will be shown in the history area, "history" is passed.

        Please note that it is perfectly possible to create more than one 
        action "instance" for an action!
        You can for example do scene introspectionvif the action passed in 
        is "character_attachment" you may for examplevscan the scene, figure
        out all the nodes where this object can bevattached and return a list
        of action instances: "attach to left hand",v"attach to right hand" etc.
        In this case, when more than  one object isvreturned for an action, use
        the params key to pass additional data into the run_action hook.
